# Code Kata (C++)

If I remember correctly, at the time, I was diving back into C++, having not
touched it for a few years, and I was trying to learn the
[Boost](http://boost.org/) library. So I started implementing some of Dave
Thomas's [Code Kata](http://codekata.pragprog.com/) with it, to see if I could
get the hang of it.

Herein lies:

* [Kata 2: Karate Chop](http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_two_karate.html).
* [Kata 4: Data Munging](http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_four_data_.html).
* [Kata 5: Bloom Filters](http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_five_bloom.html).
* [Kata 6: Anagrams](http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_six_anagra.html).
* [Kata 9: Back to the Checkout](http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_nine_back_.html).

I can't for the life of me remember why I decided relearning C++ was what I
wanted to do, but it didn't last long. Six months later, I was working full
time as a Python developer...
